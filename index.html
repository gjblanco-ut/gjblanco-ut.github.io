                        <p class="mb-0">The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a generational and forthcoming ground-based observatory used for exceptionally high energy gamma-ray astronomy.
                            Despite the fact that Earth’s atmosphere works to prevent gamma rays from penetrating the surface, the interactions between these forces produce ultra high energy particles known as showers. Due to their high velocities, the particles create a flash of blue Cherenkov radiation. CTA’s high-speed cameras as well as its innovative mirrors will capture and locate these flashes, allowing astronomers to detect the source of these cosmic outbursts.
                            CTAs entitle astronomers to observe the sky in higher energy resolution for the first time ever, enabling them to scan the atmosphere for dark matter particles and catch the burts as they explode rapidly.
                            The problem in our project is that we want to distinguish the difference between primary gammas and cosmic rays known as hadrons.All of the cosmic sources of gamma rays, like cosmic rays, black holes, leftovers from supernovas and dark matter are foundational parts of our galaxy and universe. Understanding these events and the high-powered radiation they emit is essential to all parts of astronomy.
                            As for the motivation for this project, the Cherenkov telescope is an up and coming innovation. It plays a significant role in the study of cosmic particles and the exploration of dark matter. Analyzing its work can help improve scientific knowledge and allow astronomers to learn more about space to further human progression.

                        <p class="mb-0">The dataset has a total of 19,020 rows including 10 features and 1 target which is the class.
                             Since there were no missing values, there were no rows removed. The data was generated by using a Monte 
                             Carlo simulation, an algorithm that relies on repeated random sampling to get numerical results, to detect
                              gamma ray particles in a Cherenkov telescope. Since the data set is generated using a simulation then the
                               dataset set used is all synthetic. Within the dataset, there are 12,332 events of gamma ray signals and
                                6,688 events of cosmic rays or background signals. The dataset was cleaned by renaming the column names
                                 and changing the “g” to 0 and “h” to 1 in the class column with g meaning gamma and h meaning hadron.
